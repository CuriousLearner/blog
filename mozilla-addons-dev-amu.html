    <article>
        <p>It all started with PyCon India. I met a few students of Aligarh Muslim University who were trying to teach about FOSS in their college. A few them were already contributing to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/coala/coala">Coala</a>. We talked a bit and they were discussing problems they were facing to run that community. I already started a Mozilla community at my college in the earlier days. Since I brought up a lot of folks from my college community in the event, we together discussed <em>How to nurture FOSS communities in college</em> as part of PyCon India Open Spaces. Here is a glimpse of the same:</p>
<img alt="PyCon India Open Spaces on how to nurture FOSS communities in college" class="align-center" src="images/moz-addons-amu-1.jpeg" />
<p>Later, these folks were excited and invited me as a speaker at their college. A lot of planning happened for the event and we were in touch almost daily for different things. We planned the event one and a half month in advance. Finally, on 24th Feb 2018, we decided to have a full-day event around FOSS at Aligarh Muslim University.</p>
<p>We left from Delhi at around 6:30 AM in the morning. We then halted at a cafe known as <cite>Break Point</cite> around Aligarh to have breakfast. We reached the university at around 10:20 AM.</p>
<p>We took some time to test the entire set-up and the event began at around 11:30 AM. I took the first session on <strong>Why you should contribute to Open Source</strong>. We discussed the question that somehow pops up sooner or later into everyone's mind while contributing to Open Source: <strong>What's in it for me?</strong>.</p>
<p>We discussed various pathways one can begin contributing to Open Source Projects like <strong>coding, writing docs, managing team, advocacy, documentation, translation, bug triaging, reviews, organization skills, soft skills</strong> &amp; tons of other things that come as a by-product.</p>
<img alt="Curious &amp; enthusiastic attendees learning about different contribution pathways in FOSS" class="align-center" src="images/moz-addons-amu-9.jpg" />
<p>You can find the slides here: <a class="reference external" href="http://sanyamkhurana.com/presentations/why-foss">Why you should contribute to Open Source?</a>.</p>
<img alt="Curious &amp; enthusiastic attendees at Mozilla AMU" class="align-center" src="images/moz-addons-amu-2.jpg" />
<p>We had a break for sometime and then started with the much awaited <strong>Add-ons session</strong>. Everyone was very excited to start learning to develop add-ons. I began with explaining the initial setup details &amp; discussed JSON briefly to bring everyone on the same page. To make most out of the event, We also organized a few events previously to teach basics of JavaScript &amp; JSON so that students so that they do not feel overwhelmed with the add-ons development.</p>
<img alt="Curious &amp; enthusiastic attendees learning from Sanyam Khurana (CuriousLearner)" class="align-center" src="images/moz-addons-amu-3.jpg" />
<p>Then Shashank (<a class="reference external" href="http://github.com/realslimshanky">&#64;realslimshanky</a>) took over and discussed <tt class="docutils literal">manifest.json</tt> and it's importance. Later we developed a simple addon -- borderify, which displays a border on every site the user visits. Some students also modified their scripts to make their add-ons do different things and posted them on twitter. Shashank, me and Shivam Singhal (<a class="reference external" href="http://github.com/championshuttler">&#64;championshuttler</a>) helped everyone with their problems during the development phase.</p>
<img alt="Curious &amp; enthusiastic attendees learning from Sanyam Khurana (CuriousLearner)" class="align-center" src="images/moz-addons-amu-4.jpg" />
<p>Since all of us are devs, we were able to quickly resolve queries of students. One of the most important things I noticed is that often people misspell either the name of their manifest file or some key in their manifest people resulting their add-on to not load during the debugging phase.</p>
<p>A lot of them then created addons on their own and modified their previously created borderify addon to do more stuff. I've tried to <a class="reference external" href="https://gist.github.com/CuriousLearner/1a4b08dbf642be8e4dfeb9544c9ab4c9">collect some of them here</a>. For a more verbose list you can visit Twitter and search tweets tagging me (<a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/ErSanyamKhurana">&#64;ErSanyamKhurana</a> with <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23MozAMU">#MozAMU</a>.</p>
<p>Imaginations ran wild and one of the attendee created an addon that replaces the word <tt class="docutils literal">Google</tt> with <tt class="docutils literal">Mozilla</tt> on every web page. You can see <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/husainhz7/GoogleMozilla/">his hack here</a></p>
<p>To make the session more interesting we gave add-ons stickers to anyone who answers the question about what we were just telling them. A lot of folks praised and tweeted about the addons they were generating. We were able to generate <strong>10,000+ impressions with more than 4,000+ accounts reached on Twitter for #MozAMU</strong>.</p>
<img alt="Twitter Outreach report on no of impressions created for #MozAMU" class="align-center" src="images/moz-addons-amu-11.png" />
<img alt="Twitter Outreach report on top contributors created for #MozAMU" class="align-center" src="images/moz-addons-amu-12.png" />
<p>You can <a class="reference external" href="https://tweetreach.com/reports/20714737">read the full report here</a>.</p>
<p>Till this time, I never introduced to anyone about who am I and most importantly not listed any of my contributions in any of the projects. I don't want them to feel overwhelmed and assume that we people have some sort of superpowers that we're able to patch bugs in any FOSS project. I always make it a point to encourage them and help them land their first patch.</p>
<p>And my introduction summed that up in just one line <tt class="docutils literal">I'm one of you <span class="pre">--</span> a part of the community</tt>.</p>
<img alt="Sanyam Khurana (CuriousLearner) teaching about essential things to learn while contributing to FOSS projects" class="align-center" src="images/moz-addons-amu-13.png" />
<p>We then hopped on to discuss <strong>How do I start contributing to Open Source?</strong> where we specifically discussed <strong>How to find bugs on different projects through Bugzilla &amp; Bugsahoy</strong>.</p>
<img alt="Enthusiastic folks learning about contributions for Sanyam Khurana (CuriousLearner)" class="align-center" src="images/moz-addons-amu-7.jpg" />
<p>You can find the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sanyamkhurana.com/presentations/foss/#/">slides here</a>. Then I discussed other Open Source projects I've contributed to like <em>CPython, Django, Oppia, Mozilla's Devtools, Gecko-Engine &amp; tried to find out similarities in various bug trackers.</em> We then had a group photo with some of the attendees.</p>
<img alt="Group photo at Mozilla AMU" class="align-center" src="images/moz-addons-amu-5.jpg" />
<p>It was already 5 PM and we didn't go for Lunch since students kept us busy with their questions during the lunch break too :P</p>
<img alt="Curious &amp; enthusiastic students asking questions in break" class="align-center" src="images/moz-addons-amu-8.jpg" />
<p>So, we decided to hop-on to a restaurant nearby with the core-team of students that helped in organizing the event with so much enthusiasm.</p>
<img alt="Curious &amp; enthusiastic attendees at Mozilla AMU" class="align-center" src="images/moz-addons-amu-10.jpg" />
<p>Then we clicked one last photo before leaving Aligarh at around 7:00 PM with the core-volunteers of the event who helped in all the preparations for the event.</p>
<img alt="Group photo Mozilla AMU" class="align-center" src="images/moz-addons-amu-6.jpg" />
<p>In the end, I would like to congratulate the students for making so wonderful arrangements and pushing up the FOSS community in their college. I hope they will now start landing patches in different FOSS projects &amp; we'll all meet again soon.</p>
