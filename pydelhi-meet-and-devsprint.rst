So, I hurried to the venue for the meet from Kidzilla event, but I was late as expected :P

When I reached, Anuvrat was digging deep into module. I agree I couldn't grasp much, since I reached late.

After this we had a Dev Sprint for which we moved to the Computer Lab. The Dev Sprint started with an introduction.
We had a bunch of Raspberry Pis with us, so all participants were divided into groups of four to have one RPi each and everyone started implementing Radio Internet. More info about it can be read here: `Rpi Plus Internet radio <http://contractorwolf.com/raspberry-pi-radio/>`_

So, we first installed the required modules and tried to set-up RPi. We were able to play the stream directly from Internet. Next part we were targetting at was to make a Python Script and use subprocess to stream the Radio from RPi. Also implementing a GUI was part of the plan.

But unfortunately, we couldn't do it, because of lack of time and given that most of us had no idea about connecting RPi and figuring out the Internet issues.

None the less, it was a good experience learning something new.
