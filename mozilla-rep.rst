Okay, this was kind of surprising. I applied for Mozilla Reps around 4 months ago but my application was put on hold since at that time, since Mozilla was revamping the Mozilla Reps program as Reps Next and there were not enough mentors available.

It so happened today, that I got a mail today in the morning titled "Welcome to Reps Program!"

I was shocked, opened it up and there I got the news that I'm now a Mozilla Rep and was assigned a mentor under whom I'll be working for next 1 year. I've been contributing to Mozilla from more than 1.5 year(s) now. You can get a `glimpse of my journey here </journey-to-being-a-mozillian.html>`_.

Reps Next program majorly focuses on improving personal skills of the candidate. It's completely revamped version of `Mozilla Reps Program <https://reps.mozilla.org/>`_ and you can know `more about it here <https://blog.mozilla.org/mozillareps/2016/06/16/repsnext-introduction-video/>`_.

I've a meeting scheduled with my mentor today at 9:30 PM IST and I'll update about the same in another blog post.
