Today I had another online meeting with my Mozilla Reps Mentor Biraj from 6:00 PM - 6:30 PM.

Here are the Minutes of Meeting:

- He reviewed initial set of goals I've set.
- I told about my current contributions.
- We discussed about conducting an online and an offline event.
- I plan to conduct an event teaching people about Marionette and it's usage so that they can further contribute to gecko engine.
