We all know that every year, 8th March is celebrated as International Women's Day. It is a focal point in the movement for women's rights. On this occasion, all the Open Source communities in and around Delhi came forward to hold a mega-meetup to encourage more women to take active part in Open Source & Tech on March 10, 2018.

We were astonished to see the huge turn around of 180 people including 150+ women participants.

Here are some of the volunteers who helped to make the event possible

We had 3 main technical talks which were all presented by Women having a decade of experience working in the technical field. Apart from that, we had several other lightening talks and community talks.
