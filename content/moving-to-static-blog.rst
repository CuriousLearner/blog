Starting from today, my blog is now entirely shifted from `ersanyamkhurana.wordpress.com <http://ersanyamkhurana.wordpress.com>`_ to `sanyamkhurana.com/blog <http://www.sanyamkhurana.com/blog>`_

I already liked the idea of static blog and setting up blog for `PyDelhi <http://pydelhi.org/blog>`_ and `Mozilla Delhi <http://mozpacers.org/blog>`_ made me realized that I should too shift on using a static blog. It's so much fun to do this, just simple text editing in rST or MD and it's done.

The journey seems promising and interesting. This blog is now on Pelican which runs on Python :)
