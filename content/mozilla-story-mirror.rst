We had an amazing event scheduled on October 8, 2016 at Hansraj college in Delhi University. I reached the venue at 10:00 AM where I found Anup and other Mozillians preparing for the event.

We had three talks scheduled. First one was by Anup; where he introducted people to Mozilla and world of Open Source. We discussed about Open Web and privacy issues; and the role of Mozilla is shaping the web.

After the event there were a lot of students coming to learn about "How to contribute in Open Source". Many of them inquired about contributing code to Open Source projects. I guided them the best I could and referred them to resources.

The event was a great success :)
