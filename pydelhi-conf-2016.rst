And here I am, at PyDelhi Conference, as a volunteer, as an attendee, as a speaker and what not?

So, I reached the venue at 7:30 AM and people were already there making arrangements. I and Rishabh started with final set-up regarding our workshop, and testing things out.

After this, I started going to each audi to set up the speakers and projectors. Me and theskumar were looking out for the connectors for Mac at each audi and other setup. Then we got ready for attending keynote by Kiran, but un-fortunately, I couldn't sit for longer due to preperations for my workshop, which was scheduled just after that.

Me, Rishabh and Anuvrat presented workshop on Python for beginners and Mobile as a micro-bit. First, Anuvrat took a quick session on teaching Python for beginners while me and Risabh took the microbit part.

We demonstrated 'kivy-shell' which is developed by Kivy Developers and Qua-non (Akkshay), one of the core-contributors of kivy project helped us with all the initial preperations for this. While the initial set-up took time for everyone, but everyone seemed happy after the workshop. They had a lot of doubts and we tried to answer them in the best possible way we could, in the QA session.

After that, I got to another audi to help. Most of my time in the conference was spent roaming in-between the three audis to help people as a volunteer.

Had some interesting discussions too with many people, got to learn various things, and overall this was a huge success for the PyDelhi community. Here are some of the pictures from the conference:



After the conference all volunteers celebrated with dinner.

Next we plan to hold PyCon India 2016 here in Delhi, so preperations are in full swing for it, and I'll include that in a later blog post.
