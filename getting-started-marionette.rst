I've recently started contributing to Marionette. It is an automation driver for Mozilla's gecko engine. If you're familiar with tools like Selenium; then Marionette is almost along similar lines. It's written in Python and is easy to get started with. So if you're familiar with Python and looking to contribute; then you can read more about it here:

I've always heard from good developers like `Saurabh Kumar <http://saurabh-kumar.com>`_ that writing tests should be part of your code. Although it increases the development time at that moment but in the long run, it makes your code more reliable and easy to maintain. Also you're more confident making changes to your software product and chances of breaking something and not recognizing until it is pushed to production is decreased exponentially. I always wanted to learn how to write good software and how to write tests for them; hence Marionette was something I wanted to contribute to and learn about.

I was introduced to the mentor in early 2016; but after 7th Sem exams I was crushed with a lot of things. Never the less, finally I've started contributing to it.

I've been mentored by Henrik Skupin [:whimboo]. I hope I'll be able to learn more about writing test cases and some best practices in coding.

My first bug in Marionette is https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1271330 which got landed today in Firefox 49, Firefox 50 and Firefox 51. Although this was a starting patch, but it helped me in learning about navigating my way through the Marionette code and about testing in general.

I hope to solve more bugs and contribute more to Marionette.
