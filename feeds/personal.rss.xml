me to ask myself these questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;First of all, thank you for providing everyone &amp;quot;opportunity&amp;quot; for internships.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Next, I realize, that all the volunteers were really hard working. But unfortunately, all the hard-work was actually not upto the mark just because they were actually doing redundant things and increasing their work.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

found a link &amp;quot;&lt;a class="reference external" href="//www.quora.com/Is-it-too-late-to-start-programming-at-17-if-you-want-to-be-a-top-programmer"&gt;Is it too late to start programming at 17 if you want to
