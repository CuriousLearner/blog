        <p>So, my 5th term end semester exams didn't went well enough! I was just
frustrated about the subjects I was made to study. Even the computer
related subjects are taught with an aim to make students just pass the
exams. Cram it, give exam, pass it and you know it; without any
practical implication, just cram them.</p>
<p>Yesterday, went really awful, I was full of frustration, trying to
figure out what I'm into currently and what I really want to do. Well,
choosing Engineering was my own decision. I chose it so as to learn
something. Probably I'm learning, but I didn't want to learn this way.
The problem is the focus of universities towards making students cram
even the programming languages.</p>
<p>And I don't really understand their agenda. While I know the concepts
are needed to be strong for any practical implication. But just focusing
on a methodology where  they just make students 'cram' the concepts
rather than understanding and then without any practical implication is
like telling a policemen different ways to catch a thief but never
giving him chance to do so, or better yet, not telling him who to catch.</p>
<p>Whatever the heck they're trying to do, now I'm not concerned with it.
I've decided to squeeze out the most of the information they're giving
me and then carry on to learn more and trying to apply the concepts for
a better understanding.</p>
<p>Studying Java this semester was a tough task, my concepts were not clear
till the very last, until I picked up my laptop and decided to write the
code, even if it means I fail in theory exam.</p>
<p>And once I wrote it, tried things, then I started understanding it.
Still a lot more to be practically implied, but I'm glad I tried it
against the universities norms of just cramming things.</p>
<p>While I was highly frustrated, I just needed some inspiration and this
video really helped me to recover and gain a stable mind.</p>

</div><p>Okay, so now as I've decided previously, I'll be conducting a HackerRank
contest for all GGSIPU students, which is almost done and details are
being finalized.</p>
<p>Next, I've decided to keep learning JS and Python and improve upon them.
I really like to code in Python, I've not a solid idea why, but I simply
like it.</p>
<p>And now, it's time to complete and publish posts on my blog
TheGeekyWay.com which are saved as draft from the past 3 months. Also,
need to carry on some other work I've committed to.</p>
<p>Finally, I've some time and I'll utilize it fully to learn and improve.
Inspiration tank is re-fueled :)</p>
