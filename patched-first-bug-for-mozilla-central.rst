Well, everything seems difficult until you start!

How will I make a patch? Will I ever able to understand that code? Will
I really able to do it?

Everyone has these questions in mind and various others, while
struggling to contribute to a huge code-base like that of Mozilla. So,
recently I started reading stuff from MDN (Mozilla Developer Network)
and then with bugsahoy and bugzilla, started figuring out
good-first-bugs.

The difficulty was, it uses such terms, I haven't even heard of! So, I
was actually really afraid of commenting that I want to pick it up. But
now, I was really frustrated with myself, and thought to give it a try
to any bug, people would definitely help me, and I will figure a way
out.

So, I reached `this
bug <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1221494>`__ where
enough of the instructions were already there, and it seemed like a very
quick fix. This was a CSS bug in animation inspector of developer tools.

Having submitted a patch, I got review for my code and accordingly I did
the changes, and on Feb 1, 2016. This patch got accepted :)

Now I'm working on another bug which is on JS in the animation inspector
\| Dev tools. It's almost done, and I hope I would submit one more patch
soon.
