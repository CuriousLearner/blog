Finally got some time to write here. This one would be a really quick
post. I have been really busy from past few months. A hurricane of work
just kept me crunched every now and then.

Had to complete the summer training project report, write tutorial on my
own blog, submit dgplug training work (last task), learning about
bootstrap & complete some left freelancing work, then college work too.
I was literally trying to work with all that in parallel. So everything
seemed not to move at all. I apologize to everyone, trust me, I'm trying
my best.

Then came exams; damn, I hate it, they don't really test knowledge.They
are just there to know who has a damn 'Rattafication' skill. Anyways, my
exams got over yesterday. People in my class were a free bird, but it
isn't really an option for me at the moment.

I just came back home and then carried out all the left tasks. Complete
two days work and finally I can see some output. My summer training
project report is now complete! And, and, and my reaction is like:

I'm happy as to 'something' is better than nothing.

I'm just confused and crunched between a lot to do and at the moment
internals are again over my head. A lot of work is pending and I've to
complete it as soon as possible. A lot of college work too.

Time to work more aggressively and clear all the mess up! Plus, carry on
my college studies as well.
