And here it is! We just completed 1 year of regular meetups at PyDelhi.
We organized various workshops, meet-ups, events etc. in the past one
year.

We had the meet on 9th Jan, 2016. The venue was Fueled. We gathered
there and started the introduction outside the office. After the
introduction session, we got inside and we had a small presentation
about PyDelhi delivered by Rishabh, Ashutosh and me, where we explained
about PyDelhi, PyCon India, volunteering, how to contribute, various
events by PyDelhi in 2015 etc.

Then we had a session where we explained how we used Python in 2015 in
our projects. And there were many participants. Some projects were
really good.

After this, we had the snacks and cake ready! After the party, most of
the people formed groups and were discussing. There were a large group
of students from Amity who just started programming and were looking for
inspiration. Some people just came to me and asked for help. I guided
them in the best possible way I could as per my exprience.

Soon after this, Satyaakam sir told that they would give inspiration and
showed github account of student of PyChill who was in 8th standard. The
repo was full of algos written in Python. He also showed the website
that student made for PyChill. Again, I realized what Mr. Anuvrat told
me, "Hum to Jhak maar rahe hai!".

This was really inspiring for me as well and provided enough motivation
to start working hard. After this, we had volunteers sitting around and
completing various tasks for the PyDelhi Conference. We set up explara
account, made up logo, pamphlets, resolved various issues on the repo,
made list of people for reviewing the CFPs etc.

I had a discussion on what all needs to be done with theskumar and then
left.
