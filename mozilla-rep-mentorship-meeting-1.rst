Just had the very first Mozilla Rep Mentorship e-meet today. It was scheduled to be on 21/09/16 from 9:30 PM IST to 10:00 PM IST. But I reached home early and it was held from 9:00 PM to 9:30 PM IST.

Here are the Minutes of Meeting:

- Mentor welcomed to Mozilla Reps.
- Mentor introduced himself and told about his contribution areas
- I introduced myself and told about my current contribution areas
- A little discussion on Reps Next
- Asked a few questions like
    - Why you joined Mozilla Reps?
    - What is the motivation behind joining Mozilla?
    - Since how much time you're contributing to Mozilla and in which areas?
    - What are your personal goals for being Mozilla Rep?
    - What are the community goals for being Mozilla Rep?
- The mentorship would be for 1 year and for first three months we'll be focussing on developing personal skills and little bit on community goals.
- Post that we'll be focussing majorly on community goals (on both local and global level); organising events etc.
- I was given task to submit personal and community goals in next 20-30 days
- These would be updated in every quarter; and would be worked upon.

I hope to learn more about Mozilla, it's product and Open Web through this program. Meanwhile I'm also `contributing to Marionette </getting-started-marionette.html>`_.
